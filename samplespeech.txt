Uh ... phew. Well, besides the referrals I was getting, I, um ... I actually enlisted my first few clients by this post on Facebook and asking my friend, um ... My one friend, he's got, like, 8,000 Facebook friends and I have, like, two, and one of them's my mom. No, serious, Steve. So, I actually asked this buddy to help me out and put this, like, thing up for me, and he actually went and ... and he has a lot of friends who do that kind of thing, and so I actually got a few leads out of the deal that I still do work for sometimes, and one of them is actually my biggest client, so yeah. Yeah. Then the other thing I did, actually, was sort of local outreach, uh, with local magazines and newspapers and whatnot, and I got a couple of mentions that way that led to my first "real" clients. You know, like ... Not that they weren't real before, but sometimes when they're your friends it kind of feels like they're doing a favor, you know? And yeah, and I did actually have some luck also with networking and meetup groups and stuff like that –you know, local –but, uh, I'm actually a bit of an introvert, so it took me a while to get around to it.
